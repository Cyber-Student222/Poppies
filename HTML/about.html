        Provided information for players and style of gameplay:<br>
        The player will only be informed of a man, holding a bouquet of poppies, in a train heading to his hometown and will have to make choices for every interaction he has with the folks there. These choices entail how he will reply to multiple characters within the game. Depending on the choices the player makes for each interaction, the related dialogue will be affected, and it will also be allotted as points towards a personality trait which will later affect the ending. Only after the player has obtained 3-4 different endings will the choice of inspecting the surroundings be available, as that is what will ultimately unlock the final interaction (The interaction will be available only if the player has inspected the surroundings a minimum of five times. if the condition is not achieved the final interaction will not occur and the ending will default to the ‘’ ending) which will either aid the man in coming to terms with reality or once again live within his delusions (This ending is similar to the ‘Denial’ ending, but further elaborates what happens to the man some years after).<br>
        The game’s objective is having the player unravel the hidden information by having misplaced words and confusing elements.<br>
